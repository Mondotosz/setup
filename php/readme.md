# php

This was supposed to be a feature for dev containers but as
I looked further into what a dev container feature was, I figured
I would just turn it into an install script.

## Usage

`sudo VERSION=8.1 EXTENSIONS=pgsql,sqlite3,gd,curl,imap,mysql,mbstring,zip,bcmath,soap,intl,readline,ldap,msgpack,igbinary,redis,memcached,pcov,xdebug bash install.sh`
